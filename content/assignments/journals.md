# Course Assignment: Sound Journals

## Objective
In each journal, you will conduct a detailed aural analysis of a single commercially available audio production that you admire for its sound quality. This analysis aims to deepen your understanding of audio engineering principles and enhance your critical listening skills.

## Assignment Details

### Submission Requirements
1. **Written Analysis**:
   - Compose a three-paragraph analysis focusing on the recording and production aspects of your selected audio piece.

2. **In-Class Presentation**:
   - Two students will present each Tuesday.
   - If it's your turn to present, prepare a 15-minute presentation to discuss your analysis in class.
   - You should be ready to play a representative sound example from your selected piece during the presentation.

### Purpose of the Assignment
As budding audio professionals, sharpening your aural skills is crucial for mastering the art of sound production. Through regular analysis of various musical works, genres, and recordings, you'll learn to notice the nuanced differences in instruments, recording environments, microphones, and production techniques. These journals are designed to cultivate a professional understanding and appreciation of audio productions, enhancing your ability to discern and articulate the intricacies of sound.

### Assignment Guidelines

#### Selection of Music Piece
- Choose a piece of music that you admire for its production quality.
- Limit your discussion to a specific single piece, like a song, rather than an entire album.

#### Sound Example
- Provide a short audio clip (no longer than 30 seconds) that best represents the production quality of your chosen piece.
- This example must be an uncompressed audio file.  See this website for some advice on where to look: 
  - [Best Stores for Buying Digital Music You Can Keep Forever](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-sites-to-buy-mp3-and-digital-music-you-own-forever/)
  - But note, you can't use MP3, because it's a lossy compressed format. 

#### Focus of Discussion
- Direct your analysis towards recording and production techniques rather than musical elements such as harmony or rhythm.

#### Background Information
Include essential details about the production in your analysis and presentation:
- The recording's date and location.
- Key individuals involved, including the performing musicians, producer, and engineer.

#### Aural Analysis
Conduct a thorough aural analysis of your chosen piece:
- Reference the European Broadcast Union's [Assessment methods for the subjective evaluation of the quality of sound programme material – Music](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3286.pdf) as a guide for your analysis.
- Use Corey's explanations in Chapter 7 - Analysis of Sound from Electroacoustic Sources for inspiration.
- Address specific aspects of the production, such as original use of sound parameters, standout production elements, or unique studio production techniques.
- Conduct research or speculate creatively about how certain sounds or effects were achieved in the recording.

### Presentation Format

#### Scheduling
- Two students will present each Tuesday.
  
#### Presentation Guidelines
- Keep your presentation under 15 minutes.
- Do not prepare slides.
- Bring your written analysis and a device to play your sound example.
- Start by playing the sound example, highlighting a particular aspect of the recording for the class to focus on, and use this to lead into your discussion.

### Assessment Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated based on:
- The creativity and detail in your analysis.
- Your ability to articulate what you appreciate about the production.
- The depth of your conclusions about how certain production qualities were achieved.
- The thoroughness of your aural analysis, even if reliable information about the production is limited or unavailable.

Complete this assignment with an inquisitive mind and a keen ear, embracing both your research and your own creative speculations to deliver a compelling and insightful analysis.

# Instructions

Do an aural analysis of a commercially available audio production.

1. Submit a three-paragraph analysis, along with a representative
   sound example. If you don't have the recording downloaded, a streaming link is ok.
2. Be prepared to discuss the production and your analysis of it in a 5-minute
   in-class presentation for each week.

# Context

As audio engineers, we constantly seek to improve our skills by
aural analysis of existing audio productions. The idea is to get into
the habit of listening to and learning to appreciate as many musical
works, genres, and recordings as possible. Learn to pay particular
attention to aspects of recording and production (in addition to
musical aspects such as harmony, melody, counterpoint, rhythm,
etc.). Do research on how a producer or engineer achieved or might
have achieved a certain effect.
If you practice these skills as part of your everyday exposure
to music, you will, over time, learn to distinguish the sound of different instruments, recording environments, microphones, audio
effects, recording media, etc. Above all, it will help you develop
your taste.

# Guidelines

There is generally something to be learned from both, good and
bad recordings. For this assignment, however, I would like you to
analyze a piece of music, which you particularly _like_ for the quality
of its production. This assignment’s purpose is to complement this emotional
appreciation by some professional awareness as to how it might
have been achieved. Another objective is to communicate such
awareness to your peers using the professional language of the
trade.

## General Guidelines

- Limit your discussion to a single piece of music (e.g., a song, not
  an album). Write three paragraphs about that piece.
- Create a short (30 seconds max.) sound example that contains a
  representative excerpt from the production of your choice.
- To the best of your ability, focus your discussion on aspects
  related to recording and production (rather than discussing the
  piece’s harmony, rhythm, lyrics, etc.).

## Background information

Both your analysis and the actual presentation should provide
essential background information about the production as a brief
introduction:

- When was this recorded?
- Who were the performing musicians, producer, and engineer?

## Aural Analysis

The focus of your presentation and analysis should be devoted to
an aural analysis. Use The European Broadcast Union's [Assessment methods for the subjective evaluation of the quality of sound programme material – Music](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3286.pdf) to guide your analysis. See appendix B for parameters and sub parameters. Corey (Chapter 7 - Analysis of Sound from Electroacoustic Sources) used these parameters to analyze recordings. He gives more detailed explanations of the terms in his book. Use his writing as inspiration. Below are some further questions that you might answer:

- Is the recording using one of the sound parameters in an original way?
- Which aspect of the production works particularly well and why?
- If you do not know where to start, focus on the first element that
  attracts your aural attention. Does the room in which the song
  has been recorded sounds unique? Or, is there is a transition
  from verse to chorus where the voice suddenly sounds very
  different? Focus
  on sounds that suggests the use of studio production techniques; things that would be hard to do in a live concert. If you like,
  you can build your entire presentation around one such small
  detail.
- “How did they do it?” Do some research on how the successful
  elements of the production were achieved, for example, by choice
  of unusual equipment or recording locations, through novel
  recording or editing techniques, etc.
- If available information is sparse, speculate creatively. What
  _could_ the recording space have looked like? How _could_ they have
  achieved that unusual distortion on the vocals? It is not primarily
  important that you get this 100% right. What _is_ important is that
  you employ and train your aural awareness and imagination.

# Presentation

> Two students will present each Tuesday

Your in-class presentation should strictly be no longer than 15 minutes, so be sure to be concise! Do _not_ prepare any slides for your presentation, but bring along your analysis and a device to play your
sound example from (laptop, smartphone, mobile music player).

Start your presentation by playing that sound example, but only
after pointing out to the class which aspect of the recording you
would like them to listen. Use this as a starting point for your
discussion.

# Assessment Criteria

Your assignment will primarily be assessed in terms of the imagination and the attention to detail that you demonstrate in your
analysis. Try to verbalize what exactly you like about the production, and be imaginative in your conclusions as to how this might
have been achieved. While I want you to exhaust potential research
sources (such as interviews with the respective producer, YouTube
videos, etc.), a true lack of reliable information is not a problem per
se. A thorough analysis _by ear_ should be the focus of your efforts. -->
