title: "Final Analysis Paper Instructions"
---

This paper will compare and contrast the recordings from your previous five listening journal entries. Select at least three recordings to discuss in the paper. You can explore any topics we've covered in the semester so far. For a review of potential analysis topics, refer to this presentation: [Analysis of Sound](https://dsu-digital-sound-design.github.io/s-23-mus-109-musicianship-II/lectures/week-3/7-corey/#/).

You may reuse and revise portions of your original writing from the listening journal entries. However, your earlier analyses should be substantially revised to reflect your current understanding at this point in the class. Create diagrams to visually demonstrate the similarities and differences between your chosen recordings. You should create at least two different types of diagrams (e.g., frequency plot, holistic sound stage, stereo image graph) and several versions to visually illustrate the differences between the recordings. Aim for a total of around six diagrams.

In the text of your paper, reference these diagrams using figure numbers. Additionally, when describing any aspect of the recordings, include a reference to the specific time in the recording.

Requirements:

- Length: 1,000 words
- Figures: Three diagram types from the four we learned (Frequency plot, Holistic sound stage, Stereo image graph, and loudness graph)
- Uncompressed (WAV, FLAC, etc.) recordings used for analysisâ€”no MP3s
- Reaper files used for analysis

Due Date: April 27th
