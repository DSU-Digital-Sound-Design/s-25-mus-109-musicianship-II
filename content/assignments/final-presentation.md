title: "Final Presentation Instructions"
---


**Objective:** Present the material from your final analysis paper in a well-organized and engaging class presentation. This is an opportunity to share your findings, demonstrate your understanding of the course topics, and discuss the overarching analysis topic that ties your individual recording analyses together.

**Instructions:**
- Each student will have a total of 30 minutes allocated for their presentation:
   - 20 minutes for the presentation itself
   - 10 minutes for questions and comments from the audience
- Prepare a professional and well-structured PowerPoint presentation to visually support your key points. Your presentation should include:
   - An introduction to your overarching analysis topic and its significance
   - A brief overview of the recordings you've selected for analysis
   - Key findings from your analysis, supported by relevant diagrams and illustrations
   - A discussion of how each recording relates to your overarching analysis topic
   - A conclusion that summarizes your main points and the significance of your findings
- Incorporate relevant diagrams and illustrations from your final paper into your PowerPoint presentation. These visuals should highlight important facts about the recordings you've analyzed and support your overall argument.
- Prepare edited audio clips that concisely demonstrate the specific points you wish to make. These clips should be carefully selected and seamlessly integrated into your presentation to avoid searching through full recordings during the presentation itself.
- Practice your presentation to ensure that you can deliver your content clearly, concisely, and within the allocated 20-minute timeframe. Be prepared to engage with your audience and answer questions during the 10-minute Q&A session.

**Requirements:**
- PowerPoint presentation with relevant diagrams and illustrations
- Edited audio clips to support key points
- 20-minute presentation, followed by a 10-minute Q&A session

Presentation Dates: Starting on 4/17
