title: "Final Presentation Instructions"
---

Present the material in your final papers during class presentations. Each student will have a total of 20 minutes allocated for their presentation, with 15 minutes for the presentation itself and 5 minutes for questions and comments from the audience.

These presentations should be more organized and formal compared to the informal journal presentations we've been doing throughout the semester. A PowerPoint presentation is required to visually support your key points, incorporating relevant diagrams and illustrations that highlight important facts about the recordings you've analyzed.

Rather than playing the recordings in their entirety, you should prepare edited audio clips that concisely demonstrate the specific points you wish to make. You should not need to search through the full recordings during the presentation itself.
