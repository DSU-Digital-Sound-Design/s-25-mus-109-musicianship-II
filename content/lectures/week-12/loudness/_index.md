## Loudness in Sound and Recording

- Loudness as a psychological and physical phenomenon
- Subjectivity and context-dependency of loudness
- The role of loudness in recording and music production
- Distinguishing loudness from dynamics in music

{{% note %}}

- Loudness is understood as the perceived intensity of sound, shaped by both physical sound pressure levels and psychological factors. The way we perceive loudness is influenced by a variety of nonsensory factors, including our own biases and the context in which the sound occurs.
- An individual's perception of what is loud or soft is highly subjective, varying significantly across different cultural and environmental contexts. This subjectivity extends to how loudness is experienced in different social settings and is influenced by psychological factors such as surprise, attention, and emotional state.
- In music production, loudness manipulation is crucial, offering a way to shape the sound of a recording. This process can alter the perceived intensity of sound sources, creating unique sonic textures and relationships within a track that may not reflect acoustic reality.
- While dynamics in music encompass changes in loudness along with timbre and expression, focusing on loudness alone allows for a more isolated consideration of sound intensity. This approach separates the sensation of loudness from the broader context of performance, enabling detailed analysis and manipulation in the recording process.

- Achieving a balance in perceiving prominence and loudness

{{% note %}}

- Attention in listening can greatly affect our perception of loudness, making the focus of our attention seem louder than it actually is. This psychological effect highlights the difference between what is prominent in our awareness and what is physically loud.
- A prominent sound in a musical piece is not necessarily the loudest. For instance, a subtle high-hat entrance in a mix might capture the listener's attention due to its novelty or placement, rather than its volume, illustrating how prominence and loudness can diverge.
- The example of the hi-hat in Phil Spector’s mix of "Let It Be" at 0:53 serves to show how a sound can become prominent through its unexpected entry, changing the listener's focus and altering their perception of the track’s overall loudness balance.
- To perceive loudness and prominence accurately, one can practice directing their attention to all sounds in a track equally, allowing for a more balanced understanding of the music's texture and dynamics. This approach helps listeners appreciate the subtleties of both loudness and prominence without one overshadowing the other.

## Challenges in Measuring Loudness Perception

- Equal loudness across the hearing range
- Identifying increments of loudness
- Confusion between loudness and sound pressure
- Limitations of current measuring methods

{{% note %}}

- The perception of loudness varies across different frequencies, requiring varying amplitudes for a sensation of equal loudness. This variation is non-linear and sensitive to pressure and frequency changes, complicating the establishment of a universal loudness scale.
- Another major challenge is distinguishing between subtle changes in loudness levels, which is problematic due to loudness being a subjective sensation as opposed to the objective measure of sound pressure levels.
- Loudness and sound pressure are often conflated, yet they are distinct concepts. Sound pressure can be precisely measured in decibels, but this physical measurement does not linearly correlate with the subjective perception of loudness, making it difficult to establish perceptual increments.
- Despite various psychoacoustic and ecological studies aimed at understanding loudness perception, there's still no effective method for accurately measuring or comparing loudness levels in a way that mirrors the precision found in pitch or frequency analysis.

## Loudness and Dynamics in Music Tracks

- Dynamic markings as a usable scale for loudness
- Reference Dynamic Level (RDL) for measuring loudness
- Calculating loudness levels in the context of a track
- Processes for comparing loudness levels

{{% note %}}

- Dynamic markings provide a scale for comparing loudness levels and relationships within a track. These markings represent ranges of loudness rather than specific levels, acknowledging the subjective nature of dynamics and their reliance on context, timbre, and interpretive factors.
- The Reference Dynamic Level (RDL) serves as a stable point within the dynamic range of a track, offering a basis for calculating and comparing loudness levels. It reflects the holistic impression of the track's sounds, musical materials, performances, and lyrical content.
- Loudness levels within a track are determined by comparing sensations against the RDL. This approach incorporates subjectivity from the analysis of the RDL and its conversion into a perceived loudness level.
- Comparing loudness involves several steps, including matching loudness levels at different points within a gesture, comparing loudness sensations of simultaneous sounds, and interpreting loudness within dynamic ranges based on physical exertion and musical context.

## Understanding Crystallized Form and Reference Dynamic Level

- Crystallized form as a concept of music perception
- The role of the Reference Dynamic Level (RDL)
- Experiencing the RDL and interpreting intensity
- Evolving understanding of the RDL

{{% note %}}

- Crystallized form represents the essence of a track as a singular, multidimensional shape perceived instantaneously, embodying the track's core essence, shape, character, energy, expression, and meanings. This form is understood in a moment of realization, without the constraints of time, as a unified presence of all its qualities.
- The RDL encapsulates the intensity of a track, reflecting the overall energy, exertion of the performance, tempo, magnitude of intensity, and emotional impact. It's experienced holistically as a singular level of intensity that embodies the track's essence.
- Interpreting the RDL involves a nonverbal, qualitative reflection on the track's intensity, considering its performance energy and the essence of its form. This process aims to appreciate the track as a singular, coherent whole, beyond analytical reasoning and without immediate verbalization.
- The perception of the RDL is subjective and can evolve, especially as one becomes more familiar with a track. While it incorporates the analyst's biases, it strives to objectively interpret the shared cultural perceptions of the track's intensity and essence.

## Overall Loudness Level of the Track

![](loudness-hierarchy.png)

{{% note %}}
At the highest level of perspective, the track is distilled to a single sensation of loudness; we perceive this level to change continually and to form a contour across the entire track.

This can also be called the "program dynamic contour" or "track loudness contour"

The track loudness contour is the single loudness-level of the track’s aggregate sound; it is the result of the combination of all source loudness levels. It helps some to envision this sensation and concept by thinking of a single VU (voltage unit) meter that displays a representation of the signal level, following the loudness level of the program as it potentially changes at every moment.

## Hierarchies of Loudness in Music Tracks

- Hierarchy of loudness levels
- Concept of track loudness contour
- Structural significance of loudness shapes
- Example: "Here Comes the Sun"

{{% note %}}

- A hierarchy of loudness levels exists within music tracks, similar to other musical elements, allowing for detailed analysis and comparison of loudness at various perspectives. This hierarchy ranges from the aggregate texture of the track to the detailed components within a sound.
- The track loudness contour represents the overall loudness level of a track's aggregate sound, changing continuously to form a dynamic shape across the track. This concept was formerly known as 'program dynamic contour' and highlights the engineer or producer's perspective on the track's overall loudness.
- The shape of a track's loudness can have significant structural and expressive impact, supporting the drama of the music and contributing to its movement and tension. This contour is shaped deliberately during the recording process through arrangement and mixing decisions.
- An example of loudness contour analysis is given through the track "Here Comes the Sun," where the loudness levels correspond to structural divisions and reflect the track's dynamic range. The track concludes with its loudness level aligning with the Reference Dynamic Level (RDL), delivering a sense of aesthetic closure.

Figure 9.2 illustrates the changes in overall loudness level throughout the track “Here Comes the Sun” (1969, 1987). The graph contains the reference dynamic level of the track, against which the contour can be heard. Imbedded in the contour are shapes of loudness that correspond to structural divisions; as the shapes emerge within one’s hearing of the track, their role in defining sections through their repetition becomes apparent. The loudness shape of the track is clearly evident from its beginning at the lower portion of mp to its peak within ff. The wide dynamic range of the track contains subtle changes of loudness as well as large and sudden shifts.

“Here Comes the Sun” is among the uncommon tracks in which the reference dynamic level is prominently experienced. During the final moments of the coda, the level of the track loudness contour matches the track’s RDL; the reference dynamic level is audible as the track’s overall loudness arrives at the track’s overall sense of energy, exertion, and expression (that is the RDL). At this moment, the low mf RDL delivers a sense of arrival and a settling in the place of the conception and expression in which the track exists. It is common for a track to arrive at its RDL as an important occurrence, but it is not common for it to be a point of arrival that provides aesthetic closure to a track.
