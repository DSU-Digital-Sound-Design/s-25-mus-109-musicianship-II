title: "Sheryl Crow - Strong Enough Analysis"
---

**Parameters**: overall bandwidth, spectral balance, auditory image, spatial impression, dynamic range, noise/distortion, balance of components

#### Context and Initial Observations

"Strong Enough," the third track from Sheryl Crow's album "Tuesday Night Music Club," stands out due to its well-balanced instrumental parts that complement each other, requiring numerous auditions to fully appreciate and identify all the sounds. These elements, along with the strategic panning of instruments, contribute to a musically and timbrally rich track.

**Starting Questions**

> 1. What do we think the artist or producer was trying to communicate with these mixing and recording choices?
> 2. How do elements of this mix relate to other rock tracks of the same era?
> 3. Corey notes that this recording has become a "classic in terms of sound quality". What specifically contributes to this perception? What does "classic" mean here?

#### Detailed Sonic Analysis

**Introduction**: The piece opens with an ambient synthesizer pad, followed by two acoustic guitars panned left and right, creating an auditory image that is less crisp than typical acoustic guitar recordings. For comparison, listen to other acoustic guitar recordings like [this one](https://cambridge-mt.com/rs2/lmp/acoustic-guitar-01/).

> Why were the high frequencies of the acoustic guitars rolled off and what effect does this have on the track's overall feel? Is this a stylistic choice or a technical decision?

> The guitar strings may be old and a guitar pickup could be mixed in. How do the acoustic guitar and pickup signals blend together in the mix? What are the timbral characteristics of this combined sound, and can listeners distinguish the different elements?

**Vocals**: Crow's lead vocals, characterized by a dry and intense sound, offer a spatial impression with little reverb and a bright timbre. This sound contrasts with other vocal performances that use more reverb, such as:

**Instrumental Layers**:

- A 12-string guitar, with a crisp and clear sound, contrasts with the softer tone of the other guitars, adding complexity to the track. Reference tracks for similar sounds include:

  - The fretless electric bass adds depth to the lower pitches, offering a distinct sound compared to typical electric basses with frets or acoustic basses, reminiscent of the bass in

  - Hand percussion, panned left and right, enriches the spatial component of the stereo image, with distinct sounds in each speaker.
- **Chorus and Beyond**: 
  - The chorus introduces a dry ride cymbal and a subtly mixed, flute-like Hammond B3 sound.
  - Post-chorus, a pedal steel guitar briefly adds to the sonic landscape before fading out.
  - The bridge highlights bright, clear mandolin strums, and backing vocals, both panned to enhance the stereo effect, echoing Crow’s lead vocal.

#### Reflections and Questions

>  What specific mixing decisions contribute to the "well-balanced" nature of the track? How do the individual elements sit within the mix and relate to each other? What can we observe about the frequency and dynamic relationships of the mix components?

<!-- - Well balanced instrumental parts that complement each other
  - What exactly does this mean?
- Numerous auditions of the track are required to identify all the sounds that are present.
  - Let's listen several times and try to pick out as many different elements as possible
- The piece starts with a synthesizer pad followed by two acoustic guitars panned left and right.
  - What category of analysis does panning the guitars left and right fall into? (Auditory Image)
- The guitars are less crisp than a typical acoustic guitar recording
  - On the spectrogram we can see that there isn't a lot of high frequency content on the guitars.
  - Let's listen to a few other recordings of acoustic guitars to compare:
  - [Acoustic Guitar](https://cambridge-mt.com/rs2/lmp/acoustic-guitar-01/)
- Lead vocals: enter with a dry and intense sound
  - Why analysis category does "dry" refer to? Answer: Spatial impression
  - Little reverb, bright timbre. Do we think Corey is referring to the timbre of the reverb itself?
  - What are some other vocal performances you can think of that have more reverb with a similar style of music?
  - See [Billie Elish - TV](https://music.apple.com/us/album/tv/1635388716?i=1635388718)
- A crisp, clear 12-string comes in contrasting with the dull sound of the other two guitars.
  - [Simon and Garfunkel - A hazy shade of winter](https://music.apple.com/us/album/bookends/203303421)
  - [‎Leaning On You by HAIM on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/leaning-on-you/1550175828?i=1550175838)
  - Also see [Electric 12 string playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/best-post-60s-12-string-electric-guitar-songs/pl.u-BNA6rgXsAGgMo8)
- Fretless electric bass enters to round out the lower pitches.
  - This happens at the same time
  - think of how different this bass instrument sounds from a typical electric bass with frets. Does this also sound different than an acoustic bass?
  - [Graceland by Paul Simon on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/graceland/529574560?i=529574613)
- Hand percussion is panned left and right to fill out the spatial component of the stereo image.
  - What do you hear in the left speaker verses the right? One higher, wood blocky sort of sound and a lower sound that is hard to discern.
- The chorus features a fairly dry ride cymbal and
- a high, flutey Hammond B3 sound fairly low in the mix.
- After the chorus a pedal steel enters and then fades away before the next verse.
- The bridge features bright and clear, strumming mandolins that are panned left and right. Backing vocals, panned left and right, echo Crow’s lead vocal.
- How does the song maintain a coherency despite the variety of instruments involved? -->
