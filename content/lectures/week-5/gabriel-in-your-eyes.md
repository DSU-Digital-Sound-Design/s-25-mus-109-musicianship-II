### Credits

### Musical Composition and Sound Design

The music starts with a blend of chorused piano sound, synthesizer pad, and percussion, creating a layered soundscape that is both rich and spatially expansive. Attention to the nuanced differences between the higher, shorter chorused piano sounds and the more sustained, quieter synth pad sounds adds depth.

### Percussion and Rhythm

The track includes varied percussion elements. The ability to distinguish between real drum set sounds and synthesized percussion enhances the listening experience. The stereo image is well crafted, with different percussion sounds, including a tabla-like sound on the left ([Solo Tabla Magic | Bickram Ghosh | Music of India - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r31oe7Sm0vI)) and tom sounds on the right ([Peter Gabriel - In Your Eyes (Secret World Live) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evN6DIGPIJM)), creating a broad and immersive soundstage.

### Bass, Drums, and Vocals

After the initial setup, bass and drums enter, followed by Gabriel’s lead vocal, which is warm yet slightly gritty. The vocal's timbre is well-supported by the instrumental backdrop without being overshadowed. The bass line, possibly heavily compressed, lays a solid rhythmic foundation that complements the dynamic range of the track.

### Technical Insights and Effects

Distortion and compression play significant roles, adding texture and liveliness to the recording. The strategic use of these effects, starting with the slightly crunchy drum hit at the downbeat, contributes to the track's unique sonic character.

### Special Contributions

The piece is further enriched by a solo performance from Senegalese singer Youssou N’Dour at its conclusion, with vocals layered and panned to enhance spatial depth.

## Breakdown

- The music starts with chorused piano sound, synthesizer pad, and percussion
  - Listen very carefully, there's a higher and shorter chorused piano sound, and below is a more sustained and quieter synth pad sound. What is a synth pad?
  - This track is FULL of percussion, how many different sounds can you pick out. What comes from a real drum set and what is synthesized?
    - The various percussion parts and drum kit occupy a wide area in the stereo image, helping to create a space in which the lead vocal sits.
    - Left - tabla like sound with it's bending notes - [(11) Solo Tabla Magic | Bickram Ghosh | Music of India - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r31oe7Sm0vI)
    - Right - tom sounds - see in the live performance: [(11) Peter Gabriel - In Your Eyes (Secret World Live) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evN6DIGPIJM)
- Bass and drums enter soon after
  - What drums do you hear enter? What about the fill right before this section?
  - What's happening with the bass?
  - The bass line is punchy and articulate, sounding as though it was compressed fairly heavily, and it contributes significantly to the rhythmic foundation of the piece.
    - What does heavy compression mean?
    - Show example of uncompressed and compressed bass.
- followed by Gabriel’s lead vocal.
  - The vocal timbre has a warm yet slightly gritty sound. It is completely supported by the variety of drums, bass, percussion, and synthesizers through the piece.
  - How is the vocal timbre supported by the percussion, and not overshadowed?
- There is an immediate sense of space on the first note of the track. There is no obvious reverberation decay in the beginning, yet the combination of all of the sounds each with its own sense of space creates an open feeling.
  - What does Corey mean by "sense of space" without the reverb? How does one create the "sense of space?
- Reverberation decay is more audible after the chorus when the percussion and synthesizers vamp for a few measures."
  - Let's listen to the start and after the chorus to compare the reverb; we can hear a much larger sense of space and longer decay times.
- Senegalese singer _Youssou N’Dour_ performs a solo at the end of the piece, which is layered with other vocals that are panned out to the sides.
  - Let's pay attention in the outro to how the vocals are layed and panned to go along with this vocal solo.
  - Here's a video from [(14) Youssou N'Dour - Immigres (Live in Athens 1987) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t975zX-pVlE)
- Distortion
  - Distortion is present in a few sounds, starting with the slightly crunchy drum hit on the downbeat of the piece.
    - What do you think could have added to this distortion having looked at the credits.
  - What about the waveforms during the choruses?
  - Other sounds are slightly distorted in places and compression effects are audible. This is certainly not the cleanest recording to be found, yet the distortion and compression artifacts work to add life and excitement to the recording. -->
