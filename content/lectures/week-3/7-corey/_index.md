## Analysis of Sound: Overall Bandwidth

- Definition and importance of overall bandwidth
- Impact of medium and technology on bandwidth
- Effects of bandwidth limitations
- Consideration of high frequency overtones

{{% note %}}

- Overall bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies a recording encompasses, typically from the lowest bass at 20 Hz to the highest treble at 20 kHz. Analyzing this reveals the fullness and richness of a recording.
- The bandwidth can be limited by factors such as the recording medium, sound system components, or purposeful down-sampling in digital formats to save on data transmission, each impacting the audio quality uniquely.
- The effects of narrowed bandwidth are perceptible and can be analyzed through the use of high-pass and low-pass filters, which cut off frequencies beyond certain thresholds.
- In evaluating high-frequency extension, it's crucial to consider the presence of overtones, especially since musical fundamentals generally don't exceed 4,000 Hz, yet overtones from instruments like cymbals and brass can reach up to 20,000 Hz, significantly contributing to the richness and texture of the sound.

## Analysis of Sound: Auditory Image

- Concept of the auditory image
- Creation of stereo images
- Conventions and techniques in music production
- Analyzing and understanding stereo image

{{% note %}}

- The auditory image is a listener's mental representation of the external world based on auditory input, allowing localization of sound sources even when they are phantom images created between actual loudspeakers.
- The stereo image is crafted by manipulating interchannel amplitude and time differences, creating an illusion of sound source locations between two loudspeakers. This process doesn't mimic natural hearing due to the phantom image effect.
- Conventions in music production, like those in pop and rock, utilize the stereo image in specific ways, often emphasizing the center for critical elements like vocals and bass, with other instruments panned to create balance and depth.
- Analyzing a stereo image involves assessing its width, the placement and stability of sound sources, and the spatial distribution of these sources, all contributing to the clarity, balance, and overall impact of the recording.

## Possible questions for auditory image

- How wide or monophonic is the image?
- What are the locations and widths of individual sound sources in a recording?
- Are their locations stable and definite or ambiguous? 
- How easily can the locations of sound sources be pinpointed within a stereo image?
- Does the sound image appear to have the correct and appropriate spatial distribution of sound sources?

## Questions for spatial impression

- Apparent room size:
  - How big is the room?
  - Is there more than one type of reverberation present in a recording?
  - Is the reverberation real or artificial?
  - What is the approximate reverberation time?
  - Are there any echoes or long delays in the reverberation and early reflections?
- Depth perspective: Are sounds placed up front clearly distinguished from those in the background?

{{% note %}}
The spatial impression of a recording is critical for conveying emotion and drama in music. Reverberation and echo help set the scene in which a musical performance or theatrical action takes place. Listeners can be transported mentally to the space in which music exists through the strong influence of early reflections and reverberation that envelops music in a sound recording.

## Analysis of Sound: Dynamic Range and Changes in Level

- Significance of dynamic range
- Assessing microdynamics
- Influence of dynamic range on perceived loudness
- Impact of dynamic level changes on musical expression

{{% note %}}

- Dynamic range, representing the span between the softest and loudest parts of a recording, varies significantly across musical genres and is essential for conveying the emotional depth and intensity of a piece.
- Microdynamics, or the subtle fluctuations in sound level, can be observed and analyzed using level meters, revealing how compression and other production choices influence the sound and its perceived loudness.
- The dynamic range of a recording affects its perceived loudness, with recordings having smaller amplitude fluctuations sounding louder to the human ear than those with larger fluctuations, even if peak amplitudes are equal.
- Attention to dynamic level changes, whether through manual gain adjustments or automated processes like compression, is crucial as they can underscore musical intentions, enhance the listening experience, or, if not managed well, detract from the musical impact by making quieter sections inaudible.
- Demo with automation and LUFS in Reaper to show how dynamic range can be controlled.
