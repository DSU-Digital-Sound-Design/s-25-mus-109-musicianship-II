> it is the end product of a chain of mental events that gives rise to an entirely subjective, internal mental representation or quality. Sound waves—molecules of air vibrating at various frequencies— do not themselves have pitch. Their motion and oscillations can be measured, but it takes a human (or animal) brain to map them to that internal quality we call pitch.

## The Linkage of Pitch/Frequency and Timbre as Recording Elements

- Pitch: A psychological phenomenon related to sound frequency
- Pitch Perception: Relative vs. Absolute Pitch
- The Octave: A critical perceptual mechanism in understanding pitch
- Fundamental Frequency: The basis of pitch in sound

{{% note %}}

- Pitch is not inherent in sound waves but is a mental representation of the frequency of these waves. It is subjective, experienced internally and varies from one individual to another.
- Humans generally use relative pitch to perceive music, identifying pitches in relation to one another, unlike the rare ability of absolute pitch which allows for the identification of note frequencies without reference. This relative perception enables musical transposition and consistency across different tuning standards.
- The concept of the octave, where pitch sensation duplicates at double or half the frequency, underscores the human perceptual framework for organizing pitch. It illustrates how pitch and frequency are intertwined in our sensory experience.
- The fundamental frequency, or the rate at which a sound-producing body vibrates, underpins our perception of pitch. This frequency is key in defining the pitch of both pure and complex tones.

The fundamental frequency is the frequency at which a body (such as a guitar string) vibrates; this vibration along its entire length is its resonant frequency (see Figure 7.1).

Figure 7.1 illustrates the vibration of a string. The vibration (and standing wave) along its entire length is the fundamental frequency (the first harmonic). The string also vibrates in halves (2nd harmonic), in quarters (4th harmonic), in eights (8th harmonic), and in sixteenths (16th harmonic) which are all in octave relationships to the fundamental frequency and reinforce its perceptual presence. The third harmonic represents a perfect fifth relationship (plus an octave) to the fundamental; it, along with its octave doublings (the 6th and 12th harmonics), also reinforce the dominance of the fundamental frequency and strengthen it as the pitch sensation.

## Complex Tones and the Spectrum of Sound

- The concept of complex tones
- Distinction between harmonics and overtones
- The role of the harmonic series
- Perception of pitch and the impact of waveforms

{{% note %}}

- Complex tones include frequencies beyond the fundamental frequency, termed 'partials,' which together form the 'spectrum' of the sound. The spectrum is a critical component of timbre, alongside dynamic and spectral envelopes.
- Harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, enhancing the sensation of pitch, while overtones, being in inharmonic ratios, can diminish pitch clarity. This classification impacts the analysis of a sound's content and character.
- The harmonic series, especially through low-integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, can establish a pitch sensation even without a fundamental frequency present, a phenomenon known as the 'missing fundamental.'
- Pitch perception varies with the waveform's periodicity. Sounds with periodic waveforms are typically perceived as pitched, whereas non-periodic waveforms result in sounds perceived as unpitched or with less defined pitch.

## The Role of Timbre in Pitch Perception

- Timbre's crucial influence on pitch clarity
- Continuum between white noise and pure pitch sensation
- Complex tones vs. pure tones in pitch reinforcement
- Variable pitch definition due to spectral content

{{% note %}}

- Timbre significantly affects the clarity of pitch, acting as a decisive factor in how we perceive pitch sensations. This relationship is not binary but spans a spectrum from the ambiguity of white noise to the clear sensation of a singular pitch.
- The perception of pitch is not static; it exists on a continuum. At one extreme, white noise lacks a discernible pitch, while at the other, a pure tone offers an uncompromised pitch sensation. Timbre bridges these extremes, shaping our experience of pitch.
- Complex tones, which include multiple frequencies or harmonics, often provide a more pronounced pitch sensation than pure tones. This is because the presence of a fundamental frequency, along with its harmonics, can enhance the overall pitch perception. However, this enhancement is not guaranteed for all complex tones.
- The concept of "pitch definition" reflects the clarity or focus of pitch perception, influenced by the harmonic content of a sound. Sounds with low-integer harmonics tend to have a stronger pitch sensation due to the reinforcement of the fundamental frequency, whereas sounds with numerous overtones might experience a reduction in pitch clarity.

## Pitch Sensation in Non-periodic Sounds

- Impact of inharmonic frequencies on pitch perception
- Pitch areas in non-periodic waveforms
- Role of frequency bands in defining pitch areas
- Timbre's influence on pitch sensation in recording

{{% note %}}

- Non-periodic waveforms, which include a significant portion of inharmonic frequencies, generally lead to a weaker pitch sensation. These sounds often fall outside traditional notions of being pitched or unpitched, inhabiting a nuanced "pitch area."
- A "pitch area" is characterized by a dominant frequency band or bands, with defined upper and lower boundaries and a specific density of frequency information. This concept helps to categorize sounds that do not fit neatly into the pitched/unpitched dichotomy, offering a more nuanced understanding of pitch perception.
- The density and arrangement of frequency bands within a sound define its pitch area, affecting how the sound is perceived in terms of pitch. Instruments like drums and cymbals, which produce rich timbral sounds, generate pitch areas that can span musical intervals, allowing them to integrate into the harmonic fabric of music.
- In the realm of recording, the spectral content of a sound—its timbre—plays a pivotal role in defining the pitch sensation and the clarity of any perceived pitch. Even sounds with dense, inharmonic partials can convey a sense of pitch, depending on their spectral characteristics and the listening context.

## Timbre: Beyond Pitch and Loudness

- Timbre as a Unique Auditory Sensation
- Defined by Difference, Not by Components
- Gestalt Percept: The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
- The Multifaceted Nature of Timbre

{{% note %}}

- Timbre allows listeners to distinguish between sounds with the same pitch and loudness, emphasizing its role as a unique auditory sensation. The American National Standards Institute defines timbre by identifying it through its difference from pitch and loudness, highlighting the challenge of defining timbre directly.
- As a gestalt percept, timbre is understood as a singular impression that emerges from the complex interaction of its parts. This perspective underscores the complexity of timbre, which integrates various dimensions including pitch, frequency, and amplitude.
- Timbre's multifaceted nature is evident across different levels—from individual sounds to genres of music—functioning as a key attribute in shaping auditory experiences. It encompasses both physical attributes and psychological phenomena, distinguishing it as more than just an auditory sensation but also a carrier of meaning and emotion.
- The examination of timbre involves considering its overall quality and acoustic content, including its spectrum, spectral envelope, and dynamic envelope. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of how timbre contributes to the identity and expressiveness of sounds, beyond mere technical definitions.

## Components of Timbre: Unpacking Complexity

- Dynamic Envelope: The Shape of Loudness Over Time
- Spectrum: The Frequency Content
- Spectral Envelope: Dynamic Shapes Within Spectral Content

{{% note %}}

- The dynamic envelope refers to the changes in loudness or dynamic level of a sound over its duration, typically characterized by the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) model. This model, however, is a simplification, as actual dynamic contours can be more complex, reflecting the nuances of performance expression and sound production methods.
- The spectrum encompasses all frequency information within a sound, including harmonics and overtones. Partials, which are the individual components of the spectrum, can be stable or vary in frequency and are crucial in forming the perceived pitch and timbre. The presence of formants, frequencies that resonate in the body of an instrument, adds another layer of complexity to the spectrum.
- The spectral envelope represents the dynamic relationship between the various partials in a sound, including their amplitude levels and how these change over time. This component is key to understanding the timbre's intrinsic quality, as it shapes the character of the sound by highlighting certain frequencies over others and evolves as the sound progresses.

## Acousmatic Listening and Sound as Object

- Acousmatic Listening: Beyond Visual Context
- Sound Object: Isolating Sound from Its Source
- Pierre Schaeffer's Contributions
- Analyzing Timbre and Pitch through Sound Objects

{{% note %}}

- Acousmatic listening involves experiencing sound independently of its visual origins, focusing purely on auditory perception. This method, inspired by radio and other non-visual media, emphasizes the sound itself over its source, encouraging a deeper analysis of timbre and pitch.
- The concept of the sound object isolates a sound from its context and origin, allowing for an analytical approach that focuses on the sound's intrinsic qualities. This detachment aids in understanding timbre as a recording element, free from external associations or interpretations.
- Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer in musique concrète, introduced the ideas of acousmatic listening and sound objects to emphasize sound's musical qualities independent of its source. These concepts facilitate a pure analysis of sound, focusing on its characteristics without bias towards its origin.
- By applying Schaeffer's concepts, one can analyze timbre and pitch density in popular music recordings more effectively. This approach removes the interpretative layers that often color our perception of sound, allowing for a more objective analysis based on the content and quality of the sound itself.
