## Introduction to Spectral Balance

- Spectral balance refers to the relative power of frequencies across the audible range (20 Hz - 20 kHz).
- A flat spectral balance means all frequencies have the same relative amplitude.
- Understanding spectral balance helps improve clarity and tonal balance in recordings.

{{% note %}}

- Spectral balance is fundamental to audio production and analysis.
- A flat spectral balance is a theoretical reference, but real-world recordings often have variations.
- Proper analysis ensures that no frequency range is overpowering or underrepresented.
